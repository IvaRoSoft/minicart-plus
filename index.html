  <h2>PAYPAL CART WITH WEIGHT-BASED SHIPPING CHARGE</h2>
  <p><strong>Minicart-Plus</strong> is a simple and free of charge Javascript
    PayPal shopping cart based on minicartjs.com where the total shipping fee
    is based on freight weight.</p>
    <p>Would you like to start selling things on your website? Best is use
    PayPal secture servers for it. However, to allows your customers to complete
    their purchase and ultimately be re-directed to the PayPal you will need
    Minicart-Plus.</p>
  <p>Minicart-Plus offers a simple and intitive shopping cart and few
    "buy now" buttons. Furthermore, Minicart-Plus offers a method to calculate
    shipping charges based on total weight. The formula for the shipping fee calculation is:</p>
  <p>shipping_cost=shipping_fee_fixed+(shipping_weight_g/1E3)*shipping_fee_per_kg</p>
  <p>So, at the end of the day, you can just use this code without really
    wondering how it works. You just need to set the weight for each item using
     "weight_g" and, the beginning of the code, define the following two variables:</p>
  <p>shipping_fee_fixed = 12.00;</p>
  <p>shipping_fee_per_kg = 6.50;</p>
